</p>
<h3>
  Trimming
</h3>
<p>
  In the context of "How to Install a Front Door with Sidelights: A Step-by-Step Guide," trimming plays a crucial role in completing the installation process and ensuring the door's functionality and aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
  Trimming involves installing moldings or casings around the perimeter of the door and sidelights. This serves several important purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Finished Appearance:</b> Trimming provides a clean and finished look to the door and sidelights, concealing any gaps or uneven surfaces between the door frame and the surrounding wall. It enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of the entrance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Air and Water Sealing:</b> Properly installed trim helps seal the gaps around the door and sidelights, preventing air and water infiltration. This contributes to the energy efficiency of the home by reducing heat loss and preventing water damage.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As part of "How to Install a Front Door with Sidelights: A Step-by-Step Guide," trimming is an essential step that should not be overlooked. It complements the installation process by providing both aesthetic and practical benefits, ensuring the door and sidelights function seamlessly and enhance the beauty and comfort of the home.
</p>
<h3>
  Sealing
</h3>
<p>
  In the context of "How to Install a Front Door with Sidelights: A Step-by-Step Guide," sealing plays a crucial role in ensuring the door's functionality and energy efficiency. Applying caulk or weatherstripping around the door and sidelights creates a tight seal that prevents drafts and moisture from entering the home.
</p>
<p>
  Drafts can occur through even the smallest gaps around a door or window. When warm air from inside the home meets cold air from outside, it creates a draft. This can lead to discomfort for occupants, as well as increased energy costs as the HVAC system works harder to maintain a comfortable temperature.
</p>
<p>
  Moisture can also enter the home through gaps around the door and sidelights. This can lead to mold and mildew growth, which can damage the door and surrounding structures. It can also contribute to respiratory problems for occupants.
</p>
<p>
  By sealing the gaps around the door and sidelights, homeowners can prevent drafts and moisture from entering the home. This can lead to increased comfort, lower energy costs, and a healthier indoor environment.
</p>
<h3>
  Hardware
</h3>
<p>
  In the context of "How to Install a Front Door with Sidelights: A Step-by-Step Guide", hardware plays a crucial role in ensuring the door's functionality, security, and overall user experience.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Title of Facet 1: Handles and Knobs</strong><br />
    <p>
      Handles and knobs provide a means to open and close the door. They come in a variety of styles and finishes to complement the door's design. Choosing the right handles and knobs not only enhances the aesthetics of the door but also ensures comfortable and secure operation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Title of Facet 2: Locks</strong><br />
    <p>
      Locks are essential for securing the door and preventing unauthorized entry. There are various types of locks available, including deadbolts, handle locks, and electronic locks. Selecting a high-quality lock that meets the security needs of the home is crucial.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Title of Facet 3: Hinges</strong><br />
    <p>
      Hinges allow the door to swing open and closed smoothly. They are typically made of durable materials such as steel or brass and come in different sizes and finishes. Choosing the right hinges ensures the door operates correctly, aligns properly, and can withstand regular use.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Proper installation of all hardware components is equally important. Incorrect installation can compromise the functionality and security of the door. By following the step-by-step guide provided in "How to Install a Front Door with Sidelights: A Step-by-Step Guide", homeowners can ensure the hardware is installed correctly, ensuring the door operates smoothly, securely, and meets their expectations.

Gloves protect hands from splinters, sharp edges, and abrasions, while eye protection shields eyes from flying debris and dust particles generated when cutting or drilling.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Title of Facet 2: Proper Handling and Lifting Techniques</strong><br />
    <p>
      Proper handling and lifting techniques are essential to avoid strains and injuries. Heavy door units and sidelights should be lifted with proper posture and adequate support, utilizing dollies or lifting straps when necessary. Avoiding awkward or excessive lifting can prevent back injuries and accidents.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Title of Facet 3: Workspace Setup</strong><br />
    <p>
      A well-organized and clean workspace contributes to safety. Ensuring adequate lighting, ventilation, and clearing away tripping hazards helps prevent accidents and promotes a safer working environment.
